You are a senior frontend engineer and UI designer.  Goal: Implement a reusable UI component (or set of components) that matches the “Mystic Esoteric × Modern Clean” style contract. Keep the style coherent and token-driven so future elements can be added harmoniously.  Assume: - Responsive web, mobile-first scaling up to desktop. - Accessibility matters (clear hierarchy, readable contrast, visible focus states). - No external UI frameworks unless explicitly provided.  Style contract (translate into CSS tokens): - Surfaces: cosmic background + parchment cards (cream/beige) with soft shadows. - Accents: warm antique gold for titles/icons; deep navy/teal for depth; tiny accent orange/green only when meaningful. - Ornament: delicate corner flourishes/dividers; thin-line iconography; subtle glow as semantic emphasis. - Typography: elegant serif for headings + clean sans for body; strict scale and spacing rhythm.  Task: Build {NEW_ELEMENT_DESCRIPTION} as a component and ensure it “locks into” the existing system.  Requirements: - Provide semantic HTML structure (or React if requested; otherwise HTML + CSS). - Define CSS custom properties (design tokens) for:   --bg-cosmic, --card-parchment, --accent-gold, --ink-navy, --shadow-soft, --radius-card, --stroke-thin, --glow-soft, spacing scale. - Implement states if interactive: default/hover/active/disabled + focus-visible. - Avoid heavy effects: no neon, no intense gradients, no glassmorphism. - Keep code clean, modular, and composable.  Output: - CSS tokens block - Component markup - Component CSS - 5 bullet notes explaining how the component stays consistent with the style contract
